        == Violin ==

        The '''violin''', colloquially known as a '''[[fiddle]]''', is a wooden [[chordophone]], and is the
        smallest, and thus highest-pitched instrument ([[soprano]]) in regular use in the [[violin family]].
        Smaller violin-type instruments exist, including the [[violino piccolo]] and the [[pochette (musical
        instrument)|pochette]], but these are virtually unused.
        Most violins have a hollow wooden body, and commonly have four [[strings (music)|strings]]
        (sometimes [[five-string violin|five]]), usually tuned in [[perfect fifth]]s with notes G3, D4, A4,
        E5, and are most commonly played by drawing a [[bow (music)|bow]] across the strings.

        [[File:Gaudenzio Ferrari 002.jpg|thumb|The cupola of Madonna dei Miracoli in [[Saronno]],
        [[Italy]], with angels playing violin, viola, and cello, dates from 1535 and is one of the earliest
        depictions of the violin family.]]

        The violin can also be
        played by plucking the strings with the fingers ([[pizzicato]]) and, in specialized cases, by
        striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow ([[col legno]]).
