                    == Violin ==

                    The '''violin''', colloquially known as a '''[[fiddle]]''', is a wooden [[chordophone]], and is the
                    smallest, and thus highest-pitched instrument ([[soprano]]) in regular use in the [[violin family]].
                    Smaller violin-type instruments exist, including the [[violino piccolo]] and the [[pochette (musical
                    instrument)|pochette]], but these are virtually unused.
                    Most violins have a hollow wooden body, and commonly have four [[strings (music)|strings]]
                    (sometimes [[five-string violin|five]]), usually tuned in [[perfect fifth]]s with notes G3, D4, A4,
                    E5, and are most commonly played by drawing a [[bow (music)|bow]] across the strings.

                    [[File:Gaudenzio Ferrari 002.jpg|thumb|The cupola of Madonna dei Miracoli in [[Saronno]],
                    [[Italy]], with angels playing violin, viola, and cello, dates from 1535 and is one of the earliest
                    depictions of the violin family.]]

                    The violin can also be
                    played by plucking the strings with the fingers ([[pizzicato]]) and, in specialized cases, by
                    striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow ([[col legno]]).
                    &lt;/wiki-wikitext&gt;
